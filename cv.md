## Experience

At the moment, I have some educational experience in the field of HTML layout and front-end development. 

The desktop layout of the landing page of the flower shop: <https://ponomareva-nina.github.io/Botanica/>. Layout and styling are made on pure HTML and CSS. 

Few JavaScript projects (hover-board, card gallery, AIM Training game etc). Code examples are available in [my GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Ponomareva-Nina).

Completed tasks on the HTML Academy platform. My HTML Academy profile: <https://htmlacademy.ru/profile/id1871797>

## Code examples 
Here are some code examples from Codewars: \
1\. Task:
> Create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.
>
> For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Solution: 
```
function findDifference(a, b) {
  //loading...
  let arrayA = a[0] * a[1] * a[2];
  let arrayB = b[0] * b[1] * b[2];
  let result = Math.abs(arrayA - arrayB);
  return result;
}
```
2\.Task: 
> Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
> 
> Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.
Solution: 
```
function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
 if (flower1 % 2 == 0 && flower2 % 2 != 0) {
   return true
 } else if (flower1 % 2 != 0 && flower2 % 2 == 0){
   return true
 } else {
   return false
 }
}
```
