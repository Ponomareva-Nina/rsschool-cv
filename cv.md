## Code examples 
Here are some code examples from Codewars: \
1\. Task:
> Create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.
>
> For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Solution: 
```
function findDifference(a, b) {
  //loading...
  let arrayA = a[0] * a[1] * a[2];
  let arrayB = b[0] * b[1] * b[2];
  let result = Math.abs(arrayA - arrayB);
  return result;
}
```
